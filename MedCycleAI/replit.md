# MedCycle - Medicine Redistribution Platform

## Overview

MedCycle is an AI-powered medicine redistribution network designed to reduce pharmaceutical waste and improve medicine accessibility in India. The platform connects healthcare entities (hospitals, pharmacies, medical shops) to redistribute near-expiry medicines at reduced costs. The system uses AI for verification, OCR for medicine data extraction, and provides a comprehensive admin panel for oversight.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and React Context for authentication
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom healthcare-themed color palette

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with centralized route registration
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads with size limits

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with connection pooling
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle-kit for migrations and schema management
- **Connection**: Serverless-optimized with WebSocket support

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **User Registration**: Multi-step verification process for healthcare entities
- **Role-based Access**: Four user roles (pending, sender_receiver, rejected, admin)
- **Admin Authentication**: Separate admin login system
- **JWT Integration**: Token-based authentication with automatic refresh

### Medicine Management
- **AI Verification**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration for medicine authenticity verification
- **OCR Processing**: Automatic medicine data extraction from package images
- **Approval Workflow**: Admin approval required for medicine listings
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced search with location-based filtering

### Order Processing
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart with quantity management
- **Order Creation**: Multi-step checkout with delivery address
- **Payment Integration**: Multiple payment methods (UPI, card, net banking)
- **Order Tracking**: Status updates and order history

### Admin Panel
- **User Management**: Approve/reject healthcare entity registrations
- **Medicine Oversight**: Review and approve medicine listings
- **System Analytics**: Dashboard with key metrics and statistics
- **AI Verification Review**: Review AI verification results

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User submits registration with organization details
2. AI verification analyzes submitted data for authenticity
3. Admin reviews AI verification results
4. User status updated (approved/rejected)

### Medicine Listing Flow
1. Sender uploads medicine image and details
2. OCR extracts data from medicine package
3. AI verifies medicine authenticity and data consistency
4. Admin reviews listing for final approval
5. Approved medicines appear in search results

### Order Processing Flow
1. Receiver searches and adds medicines to cart
2. Checkout process collects delivery details
3. Order created and payment processed
4. Order confirmation and tracking information provided

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Medicine verification and OCR text extraction
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding for image data transmission

### Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection Pooling**: WebSocket-based connections for serverless optimization

### Frontend Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling with Zod validation
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production builds
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimizations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Environment-based DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Asset Handling**: Static file serving through Express

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build to static assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundling with Node.js target
- **Asset Serving**: Express static file serving
- **Environment Variables**: JWT secrets and API keys via environment

### File Upload Handling
- **Storage**: Local filesystem storage in uploads directory
- **File Limits**: 5MB maximum file size
- **Image Processing**: Automatic base64 conversion for AI processing

### Security Considerations
- **JWT Secret**: Environment-based secret management
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits
- **Admin Protection**: Role-based middleware protection
- **CORS**: Development vs production CORS configuration

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript schemas between frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the entire system. The AI integration provides intelligent verification while maintaining human oversight through the admin approval process.
